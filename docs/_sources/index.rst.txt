OpenSees Examples
======================

The Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees) is a software framework for simulating the dynamic response of structural and geotechnical systems. OpenSees was originally developed as the computational platform for research in performance-based earthquake engineering at the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center. It is now widely used as a finite element application to study response of structures across all natural hazards including Fire, Wind, Earthquake, and Wave action due to Tsunami or Storm Surge.

This document provides examples ranging from the simple to convoluted!
