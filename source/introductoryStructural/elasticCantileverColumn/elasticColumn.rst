Elastic Cantilever Column
-------------------------

The following two  examples present a simple model of an elastic cantilever column. The objective of the examples is to give an overview of input format and instruction on how to perform simple pushover and dynamic analysis in OpenSees.

The model for both examples is the same. The difference in the two examples is the applied lateral loads and the analysis script.
