Elastic Column Dynamic Analysis
-------------------------------

This is a very simple example of an elastic column subjected to the elCentro fround motion. The acceleration points for that file are included in a separate file  Its purpose is to provide a basic introduction to OpenSees. 

.. figure:: figures/figure.png
  :align: center
  :figclass: align-center


To run the example download the script, start OpenSees, cd to the directory containing the example and type

.. code-block:: bash

   cd C:\Users\fmckenna\examples\
   source example.tcl


The files can be downlaoded :download:`script <tclCode/example.tcl>` and :download:`zipped acceleration points <tclCode/BM68elc.zip>`.

The contents of the downloaded tcl script file is as shown below:

  .. literalinclude:: tclCode/example.tcl
      :language: tcl
